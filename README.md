# GreetingCard

This is a simple JavaScript projekt developed in order to learn the basics of user input. This project consists of a website where a user can modify some properties of a card. 

The properties that the user can modify are: 
- The cards background color 
- The message on the card 
- The font size of the message 
- The font of the message (will always default to arial) 
- The font color of the message. 

Below is a sample image of a card.
